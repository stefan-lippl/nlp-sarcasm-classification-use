## Learn how to use Tensorflows Universal Sentence Encoder from Scratch

<br />

### All important steps are listet below:

| Steps      | What's done in this step                                  |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Step 1** | Import the dataset and get insights about the data        |
| **Step 2** | Preprocess the data for later training                    |
| **Step 3** | Build and train the model using the USE as embedded layer |
| **Step 4** | Evaluate the models metrics                               |
| **Step 5** | Make some predictions                                     |
